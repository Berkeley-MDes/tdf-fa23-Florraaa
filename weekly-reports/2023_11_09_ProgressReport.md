# Reflections
- Based on the concept of an AI-empowered note-taker, I started ideating its form and interactions based on the hardware we (will) have. This should help lay a solid foundation for hardware and software development later. 

# Speculations
- Although the design is sound "on paper", it will need further testing to validate.
