# Reflections
- This week I spend most of the time in the fabrication shop. The time spent there was enormous but I feel more comfortable getting hands dirty than before. 

# Speculations
- I will use the experience to facilitate building future projects.

# Fabrication
### Wood (more to be updated on Friday)
- Generally, gluing large pieces need to be clamped for at least one hour
- DO NOT wipe dripping glue but instead, remove them after one hour (otherwise it's going to be dirty)
- Produce the the same pieces (like instances in UX Design) using one setup instead of try to match the CAD exactly. 

### Sheet metal (more to be updated on Friday)
- Try small pieces before nailing or welding, The angle is hard to control exactly with the sheer.
