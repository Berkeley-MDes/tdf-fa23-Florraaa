# Sync between Obsidian and GitHub
The first thing is to set up synchronization between *Obsidian* and *GitHub* since I use *Obsidian* for most notes. I tried two methods: 
## Obsidian Git (did not work)
### HTTP
I followed the [Obsidian Git documentation](https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/Getting+Started) (HTTP for Mac). I successfully cloned the repository but had trouble pushing changes from Obsidian. 

The problem may be from the *Authentication*. Here is a list of some useful links for troubleshooting:
- 

### SSH
I turned to *ChatGPT* for help as I didn't have the necessary knowledge to work on my own. 

## GitHub Desktop (worked)
The easiest way is to stall [*GitHub Desktop*](https://desktop.github.com) and set the local folder inside an existing Obsidian Vault. The workflow will be as simple as this: 
1. Make changes in *Obsidian*
2. Review changes and commit in *GitHub Desktop*

# Markdown - the GitHub way
This section is about transferring previous markdown knowledge for *GitHub* use. 

See [here](../resources/_GitHub_Favored_Markdown.md) for notes about the mixed use of the markdown language in *Obsidian* and *GitHub*.

Resources: 
- [GitHub Markdown Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github) - General guide for GitHub writing
- [Obsidian Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/obsidian/) - Use this to check which ones are available in *Obsidian*

# Computational Design


# Gravity Sketch Workflow
Learned new (*Industrial Design*) workflows from another designer. 

I may further develop this topic in another dedicated journal. 

1. **Physical Mockup**: Sketch in *Gravity Sketch* (ideation phase) -> clean up scenes -> export ideal forms -> 3D print separately
2. **Interactive Mockup**: Model in *Gravity Sketch* (development phase) -> export to *Unity Engine* -> add interactions

The *Physical Mockup* workflow is easier to adopt and has value for many traditional ID applications because it includes physical feedback. 

The *Interactive Mockup* seems more suitable for storyboards (user actions in context). **However, *ShapesXR* can be a better fit since it does not require coding.**
