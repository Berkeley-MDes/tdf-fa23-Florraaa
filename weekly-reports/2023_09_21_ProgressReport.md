# Reflections
- I am exploring designer's tool to prototype AR (for my own case study). 
- I spent some time polishing [my own website](www.mingzhou.design) and it turned out great.  

# Speculations
- From Julian's presentation and my own research, I can say that Bezel will be the tool for XR designers to use in the future. It requires no coding and is more interactive than *ShapesXR*.

# AR Prototyping (Bezel)
## Overview
I attended the presentation from Bezel's CEO Julian Park. I can confirm now that Bezel is the XR counterpart of *Figma*. 

The most important feature is this:

Essentially every object in a Bezel app can have a "trigger" and "event" to be interactive. These can also be across different and multiple objects as well. This is very similar to Figma's prototyping feature.
