# Reflections
- I was mainly taking a small break and working on my portfolio and resume this week. In terms of effort, it was marginal, but it is a necessary break. 

# Speculations
- I learned from the Anthropic presentation that AI is more than I thought. The General Purpose Intelligence (GPI) can sort data and help design dynamic UI/UX. This opens up potential new opportunities in the future. 
- I also learned more about the aviation industry due to another proejct. I am posting some links below and may post more in the future.
