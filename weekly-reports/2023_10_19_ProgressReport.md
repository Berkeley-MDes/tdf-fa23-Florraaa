# Reflections
- Building hardware and firmware incrementally will save time in troubleshooting. 
- Still, job searching takes more time this week than I thought. 

# Speculations
- Though I still don't know much about coding or C++, with limited knowledge and A.I. I can still code simple applications to test interactive designs. 
- Photon and Arduino can be useful for simple interactive prototyping even in industrial design projects.
