# Reflections
- in complete sentences or paragraphs, and perhaps images or videos.
- reflections on what you learned and how you learned it
- an assessment of the state of your work

# Speculations
- in complete sentences or paragraphs, and perhaps images or videos.
- speculation on future direction for the tools (so much is changing very quickly right now, where do you think this is going? Why do you think this?)
- speculation on future direction for the work
- bonus: thoughtful descriptions of something interesting and relevant you heard about in the news or industry publications. include text, an image, a link, and a reference that you can follow up on later and share with your peers.

## Next steps:
1. Computational Design - modeling a face cushion
    - learn to model with _Grasshopper_
    - research parameters for designing the facial cushion for a VR headset
    - model the facial cushion!
2. Experiment _Gravity Sketch_ physical prototyping workflow
    - try to print a model imported from _Gravity Sketch_
    - maybe record the process if I can to see how fast it is
    - I will try the Unity workflow in a later timeline.
