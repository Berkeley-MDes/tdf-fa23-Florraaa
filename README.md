# Mingzhou (Ming) - Weekly Reports
Everything I learned about *Design* and *Technology* will be posted here.

## TL;DR
### [Week of Aug.24-31](weekly-reports/2023_08_24_ProgressReport.md)
- **Synchronization between *Obsidian* and *GitHub***
	- Method 1: [*Obsidian Git* (HTTPS)](https://linked-blog-starter.vercel.app/connect-obsidian-vault-with-github)
	- Method 2: Use [*GitHub Desktop*](https://desktop.github.com) to sync with the local vault
- **Markdown - the *GitHub* way**
	- [Here](resources/_GitHub_Favored_Markdown.md) is a living document for markdown grammar for *GitHub*, especially the ones different from that for *Obsidian*. 
- **Computational Design**
- ***Gravity Sketch* Workflow (ID)**
	- I explained two potential industrial design workflows that include the use of *Gravity Sketch* - for physical prototyping and interactive prototyping
	- This may have its own living document someday.
