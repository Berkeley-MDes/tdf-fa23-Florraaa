# Mingzhou (Ming) - Weekly Reports
Everything I learned about *Design* and *Technology* will be posted here. Click into each week to see **reflections, speculations, and process notes.** 

## TL;DR

### [Week of Nov.23](weekly-reports/2023_11_23_ProgressReport.md)
- Final Project
	- Worked on the Python code and CAD model. 

### [Week of Nov.09](weekly-reports/2023_11_09_ProgressReport.md)
- Final Project
	- Ideated and tested the industrial design and sourced hardware for the AI note-taking device. 

### [Week of Nov.02](weekly-reports/2023_11_02_ProgressReport.md)
- LLM
	- Explore the concept of an A.I.-empowered note-taking device. 

### [Week of Oct.26](weekly-reports/2023_10_26_ProgressReport.md)
- **A.I.**
	- Practiced fine-tuning the model in [ZeroWidth.ai ](zerowidth.ai)
### [Week of Oct.19](weekly-reports/2023_10_19_ProgressReport.md)
- **A.I.**
	- Learned more about how A.I. impacts design from a presentation
- **Aviation**
	- Learned future trends in the aviation industry, including new aircraft types, energy resources, and some new infrastructure technologies. 

### [Week of Oct.12](weekly-reports/2023_10_12_ProgressReport.md)
- **Photon/Arduino**
	- Continued working on the Arduino/photon project. 

### [Week of Oct.5](weekly-reports/2023_10_05_ProgressReport.md)
- **Photon/Arduino**
	- Continued working on the Arduino/photon project. 

### [Week of Sep.28](weekly-reports/2023_09_28_ProgressReport.md)
- **System Thinking**
	- Practiced system thinking on a sustainable packaging project. 
- **Music Creation**
	- Tried making music in *Virtuoso VR*. 

### [Week of Sep.21](weekly-reports/2023_09_21_ProgressReport.md)
- **AR Prototyping**
	- Dived into Bezel tutorials to work on my own case study
### [Week of Sep.14](weekly-reports/2023_09_14_ProgressReport.md)
- **Fabrication**
	- Some general rules of thumb in producing better results in the fabrication shop. 
	- **Wood**: Keep the "precision" of equipment in mind; it's always good to keep producing the same sizes and angles than try to match CAD dimensions exactly. 
	- **Sheet Metal Bending**: Try and experiment before nail them! 

### [Week of Sep.7](weekly-reports/2023_09_07_ProgressReport.md)
- **Refine Grasshopper File**
	- Compared to the *Bigscreen Beyond* Facial Cushion and modified the original design
- **Computational Design**
	- Understood the comprehensive computation design applications in Architecture 

### [Week of Aug.31](weekly-reports/2023_08_31_ProgressReport.md)
- **Rhino & Grasshopper learning**
	- Listed some tutorial (series) to follow through
	- Created live notes
- **Augmented Reality Fabrication**
	- Discovered an interesting way of building physical designs using AR overlays
- **Facial Cushion**
	- Analyzed some key parameters in determining the custom facial cushion 
	- Modeled and printed (PLA) the first test cushion (success) 

### [Week of Aug.24](weekly-reports/2023_08_24_ProgressReport.md)
- **Synchronization between *Obsidian* and *GitHub***
	- Method 1: [*Obsidian Git* (HTTPS)](https://linked-blog-starter.vercel.app/connect-obsidian-vault-with-github)
	- Method 2: Use [*GitHub Desktop*](https://desktop.github.com) to sync with the local vault
- **Markdown - the *GitHub* way**
	- [Here](resources/_GitHub_Favored_Markdown.md) is a living document for markdown grammar for *GitHub*, especially the ones different from that for *Obsidian*. 
- **Computational Design**
	- Learned some basic operations and knowledge
	- Printed the phone stand for a iPhone 13 mini
- ***Gravity Sketch* Workflow (ID)**
	- I explained two potential industrial design workflows that include the use of *Gravity Sketch* - for physical prototyping and interactive prototyping
	- This may have its own living document someday. 
- **3D Printing Retraction Settings**
	- [Here](https://all3dp.com/2/ender-3-pro-v2-retraction-settings-all-you-need-to-know/#:~:text=But%2C%20more%20importantly%2C%20too%20high,or%20even%20break%20mid%2Dprint.) is a useful guide for future reference.
